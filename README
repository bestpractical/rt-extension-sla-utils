NAME
    RT-Extension-SLA-Utils - additional SLA utilities

DESCRIPTION
    The RT::Extension::SLA::Utils plugin adds additional scrip actions and
    conditions to trigger SLA changes off of a Custom Field change, and
    support tracking which tickets SLAs are overdue.

RT VERSION
    Works with RT 4.4.0 and newer.

INSTALLATION
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make install
    make initdb
        May need root permissions

    Edit your /opt/rt4/etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm
        If you are using RT 4.2 or greater, add this line:

            Plugin('RT::Extension::SLA::Utils');

        or add RT::Extension::SLA::Utils to your existing @Plugins line.

CONFIGURATION
  Setting a Custom Field to Map to SLA
    This extension allows you to define another custom field, like Impact or
    Severity, and have changes in that field trigger a change in SLA.

    First, you need to set the name of the custom field that will trigger
    SLA changes:

        Set($SLACustomField, 'my field name');

    And if you want any SLA levels to not trigger changes:

        Set($SLAIgnoreLevels, 'level 1', 'some other level');

    Then assign the mapping of custom field values to SLA levels. If they
    are the same, like:

    Impact: Low, Medium, High

    SLA Levels: Low, Medium, High

    Then you don't need to define the mapping. If they are different, add
    configuration like:

        Set(%SLA_CF_Mapping,
            'Low' => '48-hour',
            'Medium' => '24-hour',
            'High' => '8-hour',
        );

    where the first value is a configured custom field value, and the second
    is the desired corresponding SLA.

  Setup rt-crontool to Run Overdue Checks
    To have the SLA Overdue field set automatically, you can have
    rt-crontool run the checks periodically to update the field. You can use
    rt-crontool with cron such as:

        rt-crontool --search RT::Search::ActiveTicketsInQueue --search-arg <queue_name> \
            --condition RT::Condition::SLA::Overdue --action RT::Action::SLA::SetOverdue

    Replace the <queue_name> with the name of the queue you would like the
    check run on, such as 'General'. If you want to run the checks on
    multiple queues, you will need a line for each queue.

    Schedule the job at the frequency that you want to catch SLA violations.
    If you want to record a value within 5 minutes of a violation, schedule
    the job to run every 5 minutes.
